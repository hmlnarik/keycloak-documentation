===== Securing an Apache CXF Endpoint on the Default Jetty Engine

Some services automatically come with deployed servlets on startup. One such service is the CXF servlet running in the $$http://localhost:8181/cxf$$ context. Securing such endpoints can be complicated. One approach, which {project_name} is currently using, is `ServletReregistrationService` which undeploys a built-in servlet at startup, enabling you to redeploy it on a context secured by {project_name}.

The configuration file `OSGI-INF/blueprint/blueprint.xml` inside your application might resemble the one below. Note that it adds the JAX-RS `customerservice` endpoint, which is endpoint-specific to your application, but more importantly, secures the entire `/cxf` context.

As a result, all other CXF services running on the default CXF HTTP destination are also secured. Similarly, when the application is undeployed, the entire `/cxf` context becomes unsecured as well. For this reason, use your own undertow engine for your applications as described in <<_fuse7_adapter_cxf_separate,Secure CXF Application on separate Undertow Engine>> since that gives you more control over security for each individual application.

* The `WEB-INF` directory might need to be inside your project (even if your project is not a web application). You might also need to edit the `/WEB-INF/keycloak.json` file similarly to <<_fuse7_adapter_classic_war,Classic WAR application>>.
Note that you do not need the `web.xml` file as the security constraints are declared in the blueprint configuration file.

* The `Import-Package` in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` must contain at least these imports:

[source, subs="attributes"]

META-INF.cxf;version="[2.7,3.3)",
